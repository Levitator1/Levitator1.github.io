	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	It is perhaps unknown to most people that there is such a thing as a microwave weapon which is used to attack
	the central nervous system. It is most often associated with Russian operators, and my personal experience is
	consistent with this. Energy weapons have been the subject of urban legend for many decades. However, recent
	news reports discuss significant associated medical complaints from very reliable sources such as US diplomats.
	
	<p>
	Here is a related news article. Bing searches for "havana syndrome" or "sonic attacks" will yield a plentitude
	of results confirming that microwave or "sonic" weapons are real. Reports of attacks occurring on US soil are
	notoriously absent. However, they are nonetheless real, and I know this from experience because I was able to
	describe the symptoms of Havana Syndrome as well as the now suspected nationality of the operators in 2010,
	7 years before the phenomenon was publicized in the news in 2017.<br> <br>


	<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/havana-syndrome-likely-caused-microwave-energy-government-study-finds-n1250094">
		NBC News Article</a><br>

	<p>
	This phenomenon is reported by such respectable sources as US diplomats, Canadian diplomats, and the CIA.
	Clearly, this is no longer the domain of fringe theories. On the basis of these
	very credible complaints, we have grounds to retroactively review the case of every "tinfoil hat" conspiracy
	theorist and reeavluate their stories for kernels of truth.
	When evaluating the narratives presented by such victims, it is important to view charityably any
	confusion, inconsistency, or nonsensical elements. It must be undertood that these people are the
	victims of a brutal attack on their neurology which was provoked precisely because they knew something
	inconvenient, or they were party to some conversation or relationship which was found inconvenient by
	an assailant.

	<p>
	These attacks are often referred to as "sonic" attacks because they are perceived by the victim as sound.
	However, "microwave attacks" are probably a more apt name, as it is believed that microwaves are the underlying
	phenomenon. It is believed that the microwaves induce sound directly inside
	human tissue by way of the Frey Effect. This means that the microwaved tissue inside the body, especially the brain,
	will vibrate violently, and the victim will experience intense auditory effects which only they can hear.
	This contributes to the intended effect of simulated psychosis and mental illness which the device is designed
	to create. This device is about discrediting a victim and causing them to appear crazy.

	<p>
	Havana Syndrome is named for the attacks which drove the US diplomatic corps out of Havana around 2017.
	It is believed that US diplomats were making progress towards the normalization of relations with Cuba,
	but Russia did not approve of this. Russia preferred the existing adversarial Cold War-style relationship.
	So, in order to prevent progress, it is believed that Russian operatives covertly attacked the US diplomats.
	This resulted in a flurry of fingerpointing, as nobody understood what was going on. Ultimately, the attacks
	succeeded in creating distrust and confusion, and the US diplomats departed from Cuba with mysterious and worrying
	chronic injures which were later confirmed to be of a neurological nature. This story is important
	to keep in mind because it strongly parallels my own experiences which I will share below.

	<a id="incident">
	<h2> Incident</h2>
	<p>
	In 2010, I was sitting at my computer at my mother's house in South Carolina. I was chatting online when
	some strangers appeared. They appeared to be ordinary Internet trolls or pranksters. They made bizarre
	and surrealist allusions to national security, and my immediate impression was that their behavior was
	a meaningless joke typical of the randomness which is seen across the Internet. There is one thing that
	tipped me off to the seriousness of the discussion, and that was the sudden onset of the symptoms of
	Havana Syndrome.

	<p>
	What are the symptoms? There is a loud ringing in the ears, similar to what is heard after a loud insult
	to the ear. It is a single shrill tone, like what is heard in a movie or a video game following an explosion.
	There are also some subtler low-frequency tones, like humming. Perhaps most notable is the sensation of intense
	pressure inside the head. There is the feeling that the brain is being compressed. Sometimes there is the sensation
	that the head is ballooning up or swelling. There is a sense of confusion and disorientation. This is similar to
	the feeling of having been struck in the head. However, rather than being a transient or instantaneous effect,
	it is sustained and continuous. So, in other words, this experience is similar to being struck in the head
	nonstop for hours on end.

	<p>
	There is a sensation of pressure in the ears. This is described by diplomats as being similar to what is felt
	when the window of a moving car is rolled down. This is a very accurate description of the feeling. A very powerful
	vibration is felt on the skin. The tactile experience felt on the skin would seem to corespond to a fantastically
	loud noise, even louder than the ringing which is heard.

	<p>
	It is apparent that the device is finely adjustable. It can be cranked up and down in response to the target's
	activities and behavior. I found that the more I attempted to interact with the characters on the Internet,
	the tighter the operators would turn the screws. However, I was undeterred because I was determined to understand
	why someone would be attacking me in the first place. The sensation is extremely unpleasant, but it is not very
	painful, as such. If I had known I was sustaining brain damage, my response may have been more conservative and/or
	defensive.

	<p>
	There are additional sensations, phenomena, properties, and details of this device which I experienced but 
	are not publicised, and I mostly keep those to myself in order to authenticate the veracity of my experience. I have
	shared these details with the authorities.

	<a id="consequences">
	<h2> Consequences/Motives </h2>
	<p>
	Immediately, we should see the parallel between my experience and the original Havana incident for which the
	phenomenon is named. In Havana, the object was to drive a wedge between the US and Cuba. In my case, the
	objective was to drive a wedge between myself and the investigators who were attempting to contact me.
	However, that is not the end of this horror story.

	<p>
	I sought assistance for this bizarre malady, and I was immediately declared mentally ill, but instead of
	receiving treatment, I was subjected to a regimen of what is sometimes referred to as "enhanced interrogation
	 methods" or, in other words torture. There is precedent for this tactic in the former Soviet Union, where they 
	exploited the psychiatric institution in order to control opinion and re-educate or re-program dissidents
	and political undesireables. I was given the absolute maximum dose permitted of a medication which causes an illness
	called "akathesia". This is an absolutely miserable sense of extreme sedation combined with extreme anxiety.
	It creates within a person a strong desire to sleep along with the inability to do so. 
	Then, completely exhausted, the victim is
	driven by anxiety to pace the room against their will as if by a merciless slave driver. The only thing
	you are able to do in this state is pace the room until you are almost asleep. Then you sit and rest until
	the anxiety builds again, and this is the perpetual content of your day until sleep mercifully comes. At the
	end of the day, you take your next dose, and you do not so much fall asleep as abruptly pass out. In the blink
	of an eye, after an empty and dreamless sleep, it is morning again, and your misery resumes for another 16 hours.
	In addition to the deliberate infliction of akathesia, I was subject to a simulated medical procedure. I was not
	injured, but the level of horror is difficult to articulate.

	<p>
	Now, I will put things together. These events took place during the Obama administration with Hillary Clinton
	at the head of the State Department. I believe that it was decided that I was inconvenient because I was too
	close to an existing investigation. In order to prevent me from cooperating with US security personnel,
	they elected to sweep me in as a subject of the investigation even though there was no evidence or legal basis
	by which to do so. In order to succeed at this scheme, it was necessary to manufacture a justification for coming
	after me. So, they sent US security to interrogate me over the Internet. While this was taking place, they betrayed
	their own forces and sabotaged the operation. They coordinated with Russian operatives located in the house next door
	so that their attack would coincide with the interrogation. The net result of this scheme is that, from the
	perspective of security, I appear to be panicking and reacting in response to the interrogation. This is how leadership 
	justified the outrageous abuses of civil and human rights which ensued. In actuality, my panic and confusion were 
	an effect of microwave radiation. But neither me nor the security forces understood what was going on because
	the Russians were a third party surreptitiously interposed to commit sabotage and terrorism.

	<p>
	The outrageous misconduct, the flagrant overreach of the interrogation also served a purpose. The objective
	was that I would hold a grudge against US forces or the US itself, and that that would ensure a redundant, permanent,
	and two-sided resentment which would prevent cooperation. Thus, it is seen that this is a carbon copy of the
	well publicized incident of Havana, Cuba. However, I do not accept this deviously engineered outcome. I instead
	hold responsible the primary originator of this travesty. Someone knew that I was uninvolved. Someone 
	decided that the Russians were necessary in order to create the illusion which they desired. And they abused the
	trust of legitimate forces in order to pursue their corrupt and depraved agenda with indifference to my reputation
	and to my physical and mental wellbeing. This was an act of terrorism, deliberated persecution, and provocation.
	It is possible that similar operations have, in the past, resulted in acts of violence or physical harm. Covert
	operations such as this represent an ideal target for sabotage because they are inherently a cover-up. The people
	involved cannot go on CNN or Fox News and explain to you that they were betrayed by a crooked politician.

	<p>
	I would like to point out that I was attacked during Hillary Clinton's tenure over the State Department,
	and this is the same leadership which abandoned US diplomats to die at the hands of terrorists in Benghazi.
	It should be apparent that my account of corruption and sabotage is therefore not novel. Furthermore,
	I was attacked at least a second time, and with the greatest severity. This took place around Nov. 2012,
	which was within months of the actual Benghazi incident. There may have been additional attacks, but it is
	hard to be certain because these neural injuries produce sequelae, or recurrences. They are like echoes
	of the original experience, but absent some of the phenomena. This makes it ambiguous as to whether an attack
	is recurring. However, the inital attack detailed here was distinct because it was first. The attack around November
	was very intense, distinct, and unsubtle. These are the two of which I am distinctly certain.

	<p>
	I have a suspicion that the tragic shooting at Virginia Tech could be an example of a similarly sabotaged
	operation, but I have no way of investigating this theory. The main parallels which I see are the shooter's
	claims of outrageous persecution combined with the fact that he was of South Korean descent, that being a country which
	is prominently involved in an aliance with the US against Communism. It is easy to dismiss Cho's behavior as the talk
	of an insane person. But when we take into consideration the potential effects of methodical gaslighting, 
	psychological warfare, possible surreptitious drugging, and microwave or other neurological weapons, then it should
	be apparent that we should be open to the possible grain of truth or meaning in Cho's disjointed ravings.
	This is not to excuse Cho's terrible outcome. However, it is in the interest of preventing recurrences, and it is 
	in the interest of revealing saboteurs and terrorists, and in banning them from positions of power and authority.

	<a id="response">
	<h2>Response</h2>
	This is a phenomenon that cries out for response and ownership on the part of leaders. This needs to be addressed
	as a public safety concern in the same way as fire or inclement weather.

	<h3>Detection</h3>
	Can we establish standards of detection? Is it reasonable to anticipate that this microwave device is obligated
	to operate within a specific frequency range because only a specific range is effective at permeating tissue
	and interacting with it? Higher frequencies are absorbed at the surface. Frequencies which are too low fail
	to produce the heating which is needed for the acoustic Frey Effect. What this implies is that if we publish
	detection standards for this weapon, the operators cannot immediately turn around and modify it to make it 
	undetectable. Its paramaters are (hopefully) constrained by physics.

	<h3>Reaction</h3>
	Can we establish a standard of immediate reaction to an attack from this device? Personally, I suggest
	calling all applicable police agencies. However, this does not serve to halt the progress of ongoing
	brain damage. Another option is to leave the building, but this then exposes the victim to the likelihood
	of physical threats lurking outside. There are some details which should perhaps be standardized.
	Perhaps others should be left to the individual, as it is important to thwart the expectations of violent actors.

	<h3>Defense</h3>
	I do not know of any garments which are specialized for the purpose of defending against microwave weapons.
	I have read a paper from MIT which suggests that using the wrong manner of head shielding can actually 
	cause reflection and resonance, which could magnify the damage instead of reducing it. There are garments
	available to protect against cell phone signals, which operate on a band which is probably similar or close to
	the microwave weapon. There are also medical garments which are used in radiology. However, it is difficult
	to have trust in a solution without analysis and research from a qualified expert.

	<p>
	My personal belief is that it is likely that the weapon operates somewhere close to ~2.4GHz, because this
	is the frequency employed by microwave ovens. It is selected because it is high enough to heat the food,
	but low enough that it permeates the food without being immediately absorbed at the surface. One might expect
	that the same properties might be sought for attacking deep tissues such as the brain. It's also possible that
	frequencies with a high surface absorption also penetrate deeply, so the frequency could be higher than 2.4GHz.
	I reiterate that this matter calls for treatment from an expert.


	<a id="implications">
	<h2> Implications </h2>
	I'm afraid that as bad as this sounds, the implications are perhaps even worse. I believe that bad actors
	resorted to microwave weapons against me as an extraordinary measure, because it was not convenient to kill me.
	What this means is that if we extrapolate from this event, then it should be expected that bad actors are extremely
	sophisticated and finessed at (physically) attacking their political and ideological opponents. I believe it was found inconducive
	to kill me because they did not want to send an oppressive message to their collaborators. However, this leaves open
	the question of what it is that happens to other people in cases where their death or injury would not raise an eyebrow
	politically. I anticipate that this means that corrupt politicians are probably leveraging their ties to foreign agents,
	organized crime, and ordinary criminals in order to cause "accidents" and fatal botched "robberies". Given the existence of
	a black market, we can expect that there is a supply of killers for hire. Given the funding of corrupt politicians, we can
	expect that they do not lack for options by which to harm anyone who criticizes them.

	<p>
	The takeway is this. We need people to speak out about the state of the world, or it's going to get worse. Maybe if you speak
	out, you won't live forever. But I can guarantee you that if you don't speak out, you can't hide forever. It is a
	hostile and evil tide that gathers around us. We are unlike China
	and Russia because of men who stood against tyranny to live free at any cost. Today there are men and women who look death 
	in the eye to defend us overseas. As Benghazi illustrates, they take on their shoulders all of the dangers which we do
	as civilians, and then they go to war on top of that. So, who are we to live in comfort and convenience and still shirk
	our simple duty to speak truth and demand justice? That is actually quite an easy job, in comparison.

	<p>
	I close with the reminder that the first two amendments are the first for a reason.
