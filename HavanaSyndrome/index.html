	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	It is perhaps unknown to most people that there is such a thing as a microwave weapon which is used to attack
	the central nervous system. It is most often associated with Russian operators, and my personal experience is
	consistent with this. Energy weapons have been the subject of urban legend for many decades. However, recent
	news reports discuss significant associated medical complaints from very reliable sources such as US diplomats.
	
	<p>
	Here is a related news article. Bing searches for "havana syndrome" or "sonic attacks" will yield a plentitude
	of results confirming that microwave or "sonic" weapons are real. Reports of attacks occurring on US soil are
	notoriously absent. However, they are nonetheless real, and I know this from experience because I was able to
	describe the symptoms of Havana Syndrome as well as the now suspected nationality of the operators in 2010,
	7 years before the phenomenon was publicized in the news in 2017.<br> <br>

	<p>
	This phenomenon is reported by such respectable sources as US diplomats, Canadian diplomats, and the CIA.
	Clearly, this is no longer the domain of fringe theories. On the basis of these
	very credible complaints, we have grounds to retroactively review the case of every "tinfoil hat" conspiracy
	theorist and reeavluate their stories for kernels of truth.
	When evaluating the narratives presented by such victims, it is important to view charityably any
	confusion, inconsistency, or nonsensical elements. It must be undertood that these people are the
	victims of a brutal attack on their neurology which was provoked precisely because they knew something
	inconvenient, or they were party to some conversation or relationship which was found inconvenient by
	an assailant.

	<p>
	These attacks are often referred to as "sonic" attacks because they are perceived by the victim as sound.
	However, "microwave attacks" are probably a more apt name, as it is believed that microwaves are the underlying
	phenomenon. It is believed that the microwaves induce sound directly inside
	human tissue by way of the Frey Effect. This means that the microwaved tissue inside the body, especially the brain,
	will vibrate violently, and the victim will experience intense auditory effects which only they can hear.
	This contributes to the intended effect of simulated psychosis and mental illness which the device is designed
	to create. This device is about discrediting a victim and causing them to appear crazy.

	<p>
	Havana Syndrome is named for the attacks which drove the US diplomatic corps out of Havana around 2017.
	It is believed that US diplomats were making progress towards the normalization of relations with Cuba,
	but Russia did not approve of this. Russia preferred the existing adversarial Cold War-style relationship.
	So, in order to prevent progress, it is believed that Russian operatives covertly attacked the US diplomats.
	This resulted in a flurry of fingerpointing, as nobody understood what was going on. Ultimately, the attacks
	succeeded in creating distrust and confusion, and the US diplomats departed from Cuba with mysterious and worrying
	chronic injures which were later confirmed to be of a neurological nature. This story is important
	to keep in mind because it stronly parallels my own experiences which I will share below.

	<a id="incident">
	<p>
	In 2010, I was sitting at my computer at my mother's house in South Carolina. I was chatting online when
	some strangers appeared. They appeared to be ordinary Internet trolls or pranksters. They made bizarre
	and surrealist allusions to national security, and my immediate impression was that their behavior was
	a meaningless joke typical of the randomness which is seen across the Internet. There is one thing that
	tipped me off to the seriousness of the discussion, and that was the sudden onset of the symptoms of
	Havana Syndrome.

	<p>
	What are the symptoms? There is a loud ringing in the ears, similar to what is heard after a loud insult
	to the ear. It is a single shrill tone, like what is heard in a movie or a video game following an explosion.
	There are also some subtler low-frequency tones, like humming. Perhaps most notable is the sensation of intense
	pressure inside the head. There is the feeling that the brain is being compressed. Sometimes there is the sensation
	that the head is ballooning up or swelling. There is a sense of confusion and disorientation. This is similar to
	the feeling of having been struck in the head. However, rather than being a transient or instantaneous effect,
	it is sustained and continuous. So, in other words, this experience is similar to being struck in the head
	nonstop for hours on end.

	<p>
	There is a sensation of pressure in the ears. This is described by diplomats as being similar to what is felt
	when the window of a moving car is rolled down. This is a very accurate description of the feeling. A very powerful
	vibration is felt on the skin. The tactile experience felt on the skin would seem to corespond to a fantastically
	loud noise, even louder than the ringing which is heard.

	<p>
	It is apparent that the device is finely adjustable. It can be cranked up and down in response to the target's
	activities and behavior. I found that the more I attempted to interact with the characters on the Internet,
	the tighter the operators would turn the screws. However, I was undeterred because I was determined to understand
	why someone would be attacking me in the first place. The sensation is extremely unpleasant, but it is not very
	painful, as such. If I had known I was sustaining brain damage, my response may have been more conservative and/or
	defensive.

	<p>
	There are additional sensations, phenomena, properties, and details of this device which I experienced which
	are not publicised, and I mostly keep those to myself in order to authenticate the veracity of my experience. I have
	shared these details with the authorities.
