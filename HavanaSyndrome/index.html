	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	It is perhaps unknown to most people that there is such a thing as a microwave weapon which is used to attack
	the central nervous system. It is most often associated with Russian operators, and my personal experience is
	consistent with this. Energy weapons have been the subject of urban legend for many decades. However, recent
	news reports discuss significant associated medical complaints from very reliable sources such as US diplomats.
	
	<p>
	Here is a related news article. Bing searches for "havana syndrome" or "sonic attacks" will yield a plentitude
	of results confirming that microwave or "sonic" weapons are real. Reports of attacks occurring on US soil are
	notoriously absent. However, they are nonetheless real, and I know this from experience because I was able to
	describe the symptoms of Havana Syndrome as well as the now suspected nationality of the operators in 2010,
	7 years before the phenomenon was publicized in the news in 2017.<br> <br>

	This phenomenon is reported by such respectable sources as US diplomats, Canadian diplomats, and the CIA.
	Clearly, this is no longer the domain of fringe theories. On the basis of these
	very credible complaints, we have grounds to retroactively review the case of every "tinfoil hat" conspiracy
	theorist and reeavluate their stories for kernels of truth.
	When evaluating the narratives presented by such victims, it is important to view charityably any
	confusion, inconsistency, or nonsensical elements. It must be undertood that these people are the
	victims of a brutal attack on their neurology which was provoked precisely because they knew something
	inconvenient, or they were party to some conversation or relationship which was found inconvenient by
	an assailant.

	<p>
	These attacks are often referred to as "sonic" attacks because they are perceived by the victim as sound.
	However, "microwave attacks" are probably a more apt name, as it is believed that microwaves are the underlying
	phenomenon. It is believed that the microwaves induce sound directly inside
	human tissue by way of the Frey Effect. This means that the microwaved tissue inside the body, especially the brain,
	will vibrate violently, and the victim will experience intense auditory effects which only they can hear.
	This contributes to the intended effect of simulated psychosis and mental illness which the device is designed
	to create. This device is about discrediting a victim and causing them to appear crazy.

	<p>
	Havana Syndrome is named for the attacks which drove the US diplomatic corps out of Havana around 2017.
	It is believed that US diplomats were making progress towards the normalization of relations with Cuba,
	but Russia did not approve of this. Russia preferred the existing adversarial Cold War-style relationship.
	So, in order to prevent progress, it is believed that Russian operatives covertly attacked the US diplomats.
	This resulted in a flurry of fingerpointing, as nobody understood what was going on. Ultimately, the attacks
	succeeded in creating distrust and confusion, and the US diplomats departed from Cuba with mysterious and worrying
	chronic injures which were later confirmed to be of a neurological nature. This story is important
	to keep in mind because it stronly parallels my own experiences which I will share below.
