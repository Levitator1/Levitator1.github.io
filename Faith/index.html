<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>
Many people profess a belief in God. Fewer people will claim that their relationship with God is a living, interactive experience with conversations, exchange of information, and the experience of miracles. The goal of this writing is to convey to others a detailed description of such a relationship in the hopes that it will be conducive to the propagation of faith, and in the achievement of similar intimacy with God.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is included in the intended audience, however as this is written from the perspective of a skeptic having previously emphasized logic and reason as a core philosophy, I hope that this will be found relevant to a similar audience because I, personally, had a high resistance to the acquisition of faith. Faith is not presented as a substitute for logic and reason, but as an additional virtue which is higher than those.
</p>

<p>
You will not find repeatable evidence for God here. Life is a conversation with God and everyone's life, and thus everyone's conversation, is different. When you converse with someone over the Internet, you do not require incontrovertible evidence that they are human. In the field of computing, we have a notion called the Turing Test, whereby we look at the substance of a conversation to decide if its source is intelligent. But the exact means of making that determination is not defined. It is left to intuition.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, if you work diligently at conversing with God, your experiences will reach a threshold where it is difficult, if not impossible, to deny that you are talking to God. The onus is on you to make the attempt at faith and then to decide whether the experiences you are provided meet some threshold of belief. If you are not satisfied, then I encourage you to pray (among a number of other reasons to pray). Also, later I attempt to outline motives on my part which I found conducive to a response.
</p>

<p>
Throughout, I will avoid references to dogma as "proof" or evidence. My initial resistance to the acceptance of Biblical writing was the lack of outside authentication for the Bible. I find that my personal experience of faith validates parts of the Bible (in my mind), but unfortunately these are private experiences which can only be approximated and then conveyed in writing. My hope is that, if the Bible does not resonate with you, then maybe my perspective will, and you will be motivated to reach out in faith.
</p>

<p>
I hope that this writing will be beneficial to anyone who is seeking God, whether they are beginning from atheism or some other belief. I am Christian because first, I began searching for God, and then he told me to be Christian (which I will narrate later in detail). I believe that Jesus was with me even before I was certain of Him. I believe that God and Jesus are with everyone. Jesus is there mitigating the condition of everyone’s lives, follower or not. The difference is that what we choose to give from faith to Jesus is multiplied, as in the Biblical parable of the loaves. To me, it was more intuitive to put the emphasis on the search for God first, prior to grasping the truth of Jesus. But that is just commentary on the route that I happened to take, and not a recommendation.
</p>

<a id="purpose"></a>
<h2>2.0 Purpose</h2>

<p>Put simply, God is good. But this can be elaborated upon significantly. The belief in spirituality alone offers a number of benefits by itself, but then the acknowledgement of a supreme being adds a great deal beyond that. Firstly, we are assured that our lives have value and meaning, otherwise why would we have been made? Furthermore, when we begin walking in faith, we discover that our actions have much more meaning when they are performed as an offering to God. We may have some notion of virtue within us, prior to acknowledging God. But, with limited knowledge and limited intelligence, and unlimited options about what to do with ourselves, we have little way of knowing what path will be fruitful. Without God, we are building sandcastles and wallowing in the earthly sandbox of human ephemera, but when we are contributing to God's purpose, we are building something eternal in heaven.</p>

<p>Let's consider a concrete example. I believe that charity is a virtue. I have $20, and I am walking past a crowd of homeless people. I need some of that money for myself, and there are many homeless. I need to decide whether to give, and if so how much, and to whom. What if I pick someone to give $5 to and they go to the liquor store and drink it all? Done out of faith, that might be what happens anyway, but God will multiply your efforts and see to it that they are made meaningful. Faith does not mean acting arbitrarily. It means appealing to God for purpose and direction, submitting to that direction, and living in the reassurance that when you are asking for guidance, that you are receiving it in some way (some ways more obvious than others). You don't need to see the end-result of your actions, though sometimes you might. God responds to your words and actions, and from that, you are assured that you have accomplished more than you can perceive.</p>

<p>God is the embodiment of all virtues combined. The highest of these, which I know, is love. Most people love someone, or if not, something. You may love your mom, or your wife, or your best friend. Or maybe you just love computing or engineering and you feel like there is a hole in your life. Knowing God is to grow in love and virtue and good things. Who doesn't want good things? God knows what is good for you better than you do. Some people claim that their success in business is due to God. This is possible, but I could not say. God is showing me that his goodness lives in heaven and that earthly affairs, when done correctly, are in service to Him, and they are good for everyone.</p>

<p>
Finally, there are the benefits of awe and adventure. God, after all, is omnipotent and all-knowing, and he can be very impressive and joyous to observe in action. However, he must not be mistaken for a conjurer of cheap tricks. All of the amazing things that He does are in service to His purposes. I did not experience God in action (much) until I aligned my prayers with his purposes. Do you want to see God do something amazing? To be entertained? To be comforted by the presence of someone all-powerful? To solve some personal problem? These motives did not work for me. Loving others, however, did.

<h2>3.0 An Account of Personal Evidence</h2>

<a id="the_setting"></a>
<h3>3.1 The Setting</h3>
<p>
Shortly after the financial crisis of 2008, I broke up with my partner and lost my job. In the process of breaking up, she threatened suicide. This led me to Google for "suicide", and the top result was a story about a young woman named Suzanne who died tragically of suicide. Her story affected me profoundly. It stuck in my mind and attached itself to my soul. I read her online diary. I liked her a lot. I liked her earnest simplicity. She was funny, intelligent, had excellent taste in music (new and old), was technically competent, and I could relate to her sense of insurmountable emptiness and futility. I wondered if anyone of that sort survived, or if they all succumbed to suicide, or to some sort of lingering spiritual death at the hands of a soulless world. She reminded me of someone I had dated long ago, who happened to be married, and this did not help my sense of optimism. I wondered if maybe I might, by some slim chance, stumble onto someone ideal only to not recognize her in the depths of a soul-crushing cubicle labyrinth.
</p>

<p>
A series of good friends, to whom I am grateful, offered me their homes while I worked on getting my life back together, but I was far too deeply depressed. I had energy only for sleeping, or for online dating sites, which I hoped would alleviate the feeling of desolation that I had, but it was no use.
</p>

<a id="the_church"></a>
<h3>3.2 The Church</h3>
<p>
    I got in my truck and began the long drive home to South Carolina from Indiana. I felt pursued by something; whether by angels, or darkness, or police for sticking my nose into the infamous Suzanne story. I prayed for a church, and instantly, my life skipped like a movie, and there was a church to my left. I pulled into the parking lot and stepped out into the middle of the night. I looked up into the sky and thought I saw a star shining specifically for me, but I could not explain why. I heard a noise in the trees, and I wandered out in pursuit of it and found nothing but a sick oppossum. I went back to my truck and slept until morning.
</p>

<p>
    In the morning, I returned to the woods where I met an elderly man. He took out a pocket knife and cut an apple in half and he shared it with me. We discussed the Bible, and he said "Not everything in the Bible is true. You have to discern." I have since found this to be an invaluable lesson, as the journey of faith is fraught with the need for discernment. It is necessary to discern what comes from God, what comes from the self, and what comes from elsewhere. When I began walking in faith, I found that God's message was jumbled with everything else. The practice of walking in faith cultivates faith, and then God's message becomes more distinct. It gradually takes less effort to discern, and you make fewer errors. Your conversations with God become more productive, because you dedicate fewer steps to correcting what you got wrong.
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, I received no help at the church itself. They said "Sorry, we don't have any money", which I never asked for. So, I got back into my truck and drove on.
</p>

<a id="the_eye_of_provience"></a>
<h3>3.3 The Eye of Providence</h3>
<p>At some point, I began to experience visions of The Eye of Providence. It is a great cosmic eye rendered in brilliant gold light, in a shape similar to the Helix Nebula, an astronomical object. It can be seen on US currency. I found it interesting that at some point after having seen it in vision, I learned that it is specifically a Christian symbol, and not some generic symbol for God, or a god, etc. I should note that the color of the eye is important. The gold one is The Father in heaven.</p>

<p>One night, I laid in bed and I prayed, and I told God "What if we were to spread faith together? What if you tell me what to do, and then you intervene so as to lend significance to my action, and then both I and someone else benefit from the demonstration?" I did not receive an answer I understod, but God was listening. I would add that when you talk to God successfully, it becomes less clear whose idea is whose. Sometimes I think God does all the thinking, and we are just a vessel for free will and desires and experiences.</p>

<p>I was excited to share the experience of the Eye of Providence with someone, so I went to the local coffee shop, which is a ministry. I wasn't sure who to tell, or where it would have some sort of supernatural impact, which is what I wanted to achieve. I sat at the coffee bar and contemplated telling the barista. Just then, the cross displayed on the wall glowed gold, and I decided that this was definitely confirmation. So, I told the barista about the Eye of Providence, and she revealed that she had such a tattoo hidden under her shirt. However, she refused my invitation to talk about it, saying that it was something occult she wanted to get rid of.</p>

<p>I don't know to what extent this served to benefit the barista. However, to me, it was confirmation that there was purpose and meaning behind the responses which I perceived from God.</p>

<a id="the_blind_monk_puzzle"></a>
<h3>3.4 The Blind Monk Puzzle</h3>
<p>
One day, without going into great detail, I was metaphorically peering into the abyss. At that moment, I received an intense premonition of the actual abyss and I resolved to change course. I had a sudden certainty that God was telling me that I would find what I was looking for at the local coffee shop ministry. I hurried there with the expectation that I was going to meet someone. I traversed the establishment from front to back searching for this person, until I wandered into the very back room and the door locked behind me. I tried the back door which faced the outside, and it was also locked. It was dark and hard to see. I called for help and banged on the inner door, but there was another room, and then an auditorioum between me and the coffee bar, where everyone was. There was no way they would hear me. Above the back door was a bumper sticker which read "SOUL", as if to declare the room's confined contents. I had this electric sensation in my head that assured me that this was an act of God. I had been praying for more faith, so here I was, not exactly in an emergency, but in a definite quandry, and I felt like God was inviting me to grow in faith. So, I decided that I would give myself to faith so as to exit the room by some miracle. The thought of passing ghost-like through the wall crossed my mind.
</p>

<p>
So, I closed my eyes and prayed for guidance. I felt my way through the room purely by faith. I took a few steps to my left. I turned ninety degrees. Then I walked straight through a doorway I had not seen yet in the dark. I bumped into the wall and opened my eyes. In front of me, there was a circuit breaker, which I threw. The staff immediately came and let me out. They said "Wow! That was pretty smart of you!". I sheepishly hurried home, unable to describe what had just happened.
</p>
    
<p>
This is not a demonstration of how to apply faith to your daily life. In your daily life, you are supposed to keep your eyes open and use all of your senses and faculties in concert with faith in order to do the best you can. This worked because I had specifically prayed for a demonstration of faith at work, and when it was provided to me, I recognized it and chose to go with it. Because of events like this, I now believe very strongly, and I am willing to look for opportunities to work with God for the benefit of others. People tend to find ready excuses for which to dismiss individual events as coincidences and accidents, so those of us who believe rely on God to show us how to bring maximum intimacy and meaning into the lives of others so that they will reach outside earthly confines.
</p>

<a id="epiphany"></a>
<h3>3.5 Epiphany</h3>
<p>
One day, I was having another distinctly spiritual experience. I closed my eyes and prayed for faith. I saw the Eye of Providence again, and I experienced the vaguest intimation of water flowing around and past me, as if I were swimming towards the eye. So, I prayed "I guess I'm supposed to go swimming? In January?". "At the pool?", I asked, and the answer seemed to come back "The ocean". This seemed like a daunting task in early January, but faith seemed like a worthwhile reward, so I went about the business of obeying. Before I could go swimming, I felt that I was told "You don't have to do that", so I went home.</p>

<p>I logged onto an Internet chat room to share this story with whoever would listen, and they noted that the day on which this happened was a Christian feast day; Epiphany. Not knowing much about Christian tradition, I searched Wikipedia for "Epiphany", and immediately discovered that there is a tradition of going swimming in the icy winter ocean on the occasion of Epiphany. I had specifically asked God for some demonstration which I could not confuse with a psychological anomaly. The receipt of new knowledge through prayer (the knowledge of the winter swimming tradition) qualifies. It is one thing to contemplate the possibility that my brain is creating illusions, but for this to be an illusion, I would have to have acquired outside information from nothing. It is an illustration of the density with which God packages meaning when we consider that the word "epiphany" means a sudden revelation or realization. 
</p>

<a id="a_subtle_emphasis"></a>
<h3>3.6 A Subtle Emphasis</h3>
<p>
One day, early on in my pursuit of faith, I had the odd buzzing in my head that I had begun to associate with supernatural intervention. I was getting into my truck to drive home, and a man approached and asked for a ride. I invited him into the truck, and we began driving. I am a rather shy person, and afraid to stick my neck out for faith lest I humiliate myself by being mistaken, but nevertheless, I invited the man to pray, and we prayed together as I drove. It was perhaps partly cloudy. The instant we finished praying, we were caught in a sudden downpour that must have lasted for less than a minute. I felt like this was some sort of intervention intended to emphasize the meaning and significance of our prayer just completed, and I wondered if my companion thought the same, but we completed our trip in silence.
</p>

<p>On a different occasion, I was riding my bicycle to my favorite coffee shop, when I saw a scrap of paper on the ground. A very unusual thought jumped to mind, "Pick it up!". So, I bent down and picked it up, and discovered that it was the empty cover for a Bible. I interpreted this to mean that I was intended to write my own testimony of faith.</p>

<a id="human_life_and_gods_purpose"></a>
<h3>4.0 Human Life and God's Purpose</h3>

<blockquote>
He said therefore, “What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.”
</blockquote><cite>Luke 13:18-19</cite>
    
<p>
Here, I do not attempt to give a complete account of God's purpose, as he is infinite, life is infinite, and there is no telling what future phases of spiritual development hold for us. I will, however, present my understanding of the spiritual setting presented to us as earth-dwelling humans. God creates free-willed life in order to create love. He created us to love each other and to love Him. God creates life, which is something that starts from some initial stage and grows over time. Spirituality is similar. We may start out in life valuing mechanistic computer-like virtues which are low in the spiritual order, such as logic. As we grow, however, we become better acquainted with higher virtues such as love. You may find that you love friends, family, or pets, and no reason or caclulation is necessarily needed to justify it. These beings are irreplaceable. If you have a wife whom you love, you cannot define your love as a list of satisfied criteria and substitute for your wife someone else who satisfies the same criteria. The people we love are irreplaceable and they are valuable intrinsically and of themselves.
</p>

<blockquote>
A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
</blockquote><cite>John 13:34</cite>
    
<p>
So, put succintly, God's purpose for people on earth is to grow so that they can love. Here growth is meant in a more abstract sense than just physical or intellectual growth. Every person is good becaue they possess some measure of virtue. Spiritual life is the process by which virtues are cultivated, grown, and connected to new virtues, which are likewise cultivated and grown. The highest virtue which I can propose being, again, love.
</p>
    
<p>
How can God, an omnipotent being benefit from your help? I can think of two ways. One a bit more abstract, and one more specific. God's love is infinite, but I have the sense that even so, his love plus your love is more than his alone; otherwise, why would he have created you? In a more specific sense which correlates with the first, we have free will, so we are free to say "no" to God, or to just fail to notice him. And so, each person who chooses to advocate for God is creating new opportunities for others to recognize God and seek Him, and that is also an act of love.
</p>

<a id="spirituality_and_the_purpose_of_faith_and_miracles"></a>
<h3>5.0 Spirituality and the Purpose of Faith and Miracles</h3>
<p>
The purpose of faith and miracles is to elevate man beyond the confines of earthly concerns and into the realm of the heavenly and spiritual. The virtue of logic is rather earthly. You can transfer some logical or mathematical formula from person to person, or even to a machine, and it can then be evaluated or verified for truth. Love is also a virtue. Anyone who has felt love knows that it is real, but it is more spiritual, and so we do not possess an earthly handle on it. It is not formulaic. You cannot, for example, copy the love of a specific person, like you can a mathematical expression. Let's consider what it means for love to be real. Do we mean that it is some neurological effect such as a stimulation of circuitry, or the release of a neurotransmitter? Or do we accept that the people we love have some intrinsic value which we are experiencing as an emotion? This is something of a personal choice. I believe that the person who is more grown-up will always accept that love is real in the spiritual sense and not just the neurological one. If you think that love is just a neurological effect, then I encourage you to actively search for more love and continue to reexamine the questions of how you justify it or whether loved ones are interchangeable. Would it be fine with you if something happened to a loved one and you never found out about it? Or do you acknowledge that they have some intrinsic value?
</p>

<p>
In examining something like love, we begin to see reality taking a departure from science or logic and such. We know that love is real from our experience of it, yet it defies measurement, testability, repeatability, or transferability. And this is not a case where we handwave and say "Well, science just hasn't advanced that far yet." Indeed, how do you calculate the value of human life? But you can feel it. Spiritual things are real, but they are higher than the physical confines of our bodies. The purpose of faith and miracles is to bring us closer to spiritual things such as love and God. God is like love, in that He comes into your life partly as a result of a growth process, and partly as a consequence of your reaching out to Him. Like love, He is highly personal and difficult to represent, transfer, or prove, but that doesn't mean He is not real.</p>

<p>    
So, to summarize, the purpose of faith and miracles is to carry man skyward towards the spiritual. So the next question might be: what is spirituality aside from growth in virtue? I think that it is safe to say that it includes God, who is in charge of creation, and who created us for our own good. We can also see that love is a highly spiritual virtue close to God. We can see that both love and God are transcendent connections among living beings. Can we reasonably agree that if love has some intrinsic value, then maybe our experiences and emotions and sensations have some intrinsic value or meaning? Do qualia, or the ineffable perceptions of existence, have a meaning? What is it that is experiencing those things? Is it a soul or a spirit? Does the contents of our spirit attract or repel other spirits depending on their qualities? I am afraid that I have more questions than understanding of spirituality, but I am comforted by the confidence that it includes humanity, love, and foremost, the journey into God. I tend to think that our relationship with God and virtue has some abstract way of coloring the totality of our emotional, aesthetic, perceptual, and experiential state in a way that is perhaps more important than sensory input from the world, and this is related to spirituality.
</p>
    
<a id="the_seed_of_faith"></a>
<h3>6.0 The Seed of Faith</h3>
<blockquote>
He replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”
</blockquote> <cite>Matthew 17:20</cite>

<p>
In spiritual growth, through progress in virtue, we take lessons from the cultivation of the virtues we start out with, and this experience grants us the acquisition of or improved appreciation for other virtues.
</p>

<p>
In formal logical systems, we begin with axioms, which are statements which are irreducible or self-evident. Then we perform logical operations on those axioms to derive sometimes infinite additional truths.
</p>

<p>
In computing, we have a notion of a bootstrap, which is a reliable and simplistic chunk of instructions which is easy for hardware to invoke, and which then loads the bulk of a much more complex system.
</p>

<p>
 Faith grows from almost nothing in a similar fashion. My hope is that the sum of your brushes with God, whether through media, friends, or other experiences, will reach a threshold where you feel motivated to begin praying for faith. If you have enough faith to pray for faith, then you have a mustard seed of faith. The only question is whether your motive is suitable for God's purposes, but that question is between you God.
</p>

<a id="conversing_with_god"></a>
<h3>7.0 Conversing with God</h3>

<p>
Man is a cauldron of conflicting ideas, tendencies, and emotions. Sometimes we laugh at dark humor. Sometimes our thoughts and emotions towards others are not kind. At times, I have been dismayed at myself with the realization that the funniest jokes that I could come up with were always at someone else's expense. We are constantly judging others and speculating about what they do or don't deserve. We can be aesthetically ugly, substiting vulgarity for meaning, or sometimes we can value or indulge in ideas, or art, or symbolisms which are just not good. The natural person, the pre-spiritual person, may take the position that it is only their outward actions which are morally significant. They don't realize that their thoughts and feelings have relevance in a spiritual sense, or that they have bearing on their relationship with God. This is not just in some abstract spiritual sense of opposite forces repelling in some vague way. I do believe that this is the case, but in addition, there are more practical considerations of signal-to-noise ratio in the pursuit of information exchange with God.
</p>
  
<p>
Everyone talks to God. Everyone is guided by God. Jesus is within us, and he is constantly mitigating our flawed nature and cleaning up after us. The fundamental problem in conversing intelligibly with God is discernment. If you don't know what is good, then how can you recognize what is God? Even after you come to the realization that your unclean spiritual content is interfering with your relationship with God, it is a process to purge the noise from your heart and mind. The parts of your spirit which you neglect wither away, and the parts that you cultivate grow. Luckily, you are not left to this quandry alone. Jesus is known as a redeemer and his reason for being is to assist you in cleansing yourself not only so that you are acceptable to approach God's presence, but so that you can hear Him distinctly. Some people identify as "Born Again Christians". I don't know what that means, officially. However, firsthand, I can attest to an experience of spiritual death, judgment, and rebirth. Being judged is not a bad thing. It is to your great benefit, and you should pray for such an experience so that you can learn right from wrong.
</p>
 
<p>
So, with caveats about spiritual hygiene out of the way, how do we talk to God? The answer is prayer. What do you say? Anything you want, although I suggest respect and deferrence. The notion of outgoing prayer is a well accepted and entrenched tradition. However, the idea that you can receive a reply is less well accepted. The truth is that many of the statments and ideas you have knocking around in your head are God's, but only the good ones. He sounds very much like you thinking to yourself. So, here, we come back to the issue of signal-to-noise ratio. If you are inhabited by the capricious spirit of some error or other, and it is constantly screaming nonsense at you, that is going to obfuscate God's reply. When you start out talking to God, your primary way of testing whether some reply is his is to ask "Is that good? Is that something God would say?", and then you can attempt to select an answer out of the noise. However, there are times where your reply does not have some readily discernable moral value. Maybe it is "42", or the color "blue". In that case, if you are lacking in spiritual development, you may have difficulty.
</p>
 
<p>
Nothing I am saying here is written in stone. It is my personal experience, but you can work out any number of agreements and strategies with Jesus to make spiritual progress. The important thing is to walk in faith as much as you can because the things you do in faith are multiplied, and the other stuff is less important. Do the best you can with what you believe at a given time, pray, and walk in faith, in that order, and repeat.
</p>
    
<a id="walking_with_god"></a>
<h3>8.0 Walking with God</h3>

<blockquote>
If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.
    </blockquote><cite>John 14:15-17</cite>
    
<blockquote>
And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them.
</blockquote><cite> Ezekiel 11:19-20 </cite>   
 
<p>
This section is closely related to the previous one about how to establish a dialogue with God. Also, walking with God and Walking in Faith are synonymous. At some point in my search for intimacy with God, I asked Him to take up residence in my heart and mind, and to make use of them in whatever way served his purposes. This is helpful to augment your verbal/thought dialogue with God, which as we described, is flawed and hindered by your spiritual impurities (as is your entire relationship with God). It is desireable to seek the largest contact area possible with God. As outlined in the previous section, one of the chief ways that God communicates with you is by thinking for you. As you grow in intimacy with God you may notice some additional phenomena.</p>
    
<ul>
    <li><b>Visions</b>: Light. Stylized renderings of images, movies, or stories seen over your field of vision, or incorporated into it</li>
    <li><b>Phosphenes</b>: Momentary flashes or points of light that flicker for emphasis or to get your attention</li>
    <li><b>Sensations</b>: Similar to phosphenes, but tactile. Also: pin pricks, tingling, pressure, warmth, cold.</li>
    <li><b>Thought resistance</b>: Somtimes when you are in the process of thinking something incorrect, you feel a resistance to completion of that thought. It is wise to accept correction.</li>
    <li><b>Memory loss</b>: This sounds like a bad thing, but often times there are intermediate steps in reaching a conclusion, or there is stuff which is confusing or ambiguous, and it is forgotten for you so as to avoid confusion. Again, it is counterproductive to resist this guidance. Remember that faith is higher than reason.</li>
    <li><b>Unexpected Meaning</b>: Did two things coincide because God aligned them specifically so that they would have meaning to you in a specific moment? Or did he just fire a neuron in your head so that you would connect the two, whether as a conclusion, or as an intermediate step in arriving at truth? It doesn't really matter which of the two it is. Faith is about feeling your way past ambiguity onward to purpose and meaning, on which I will elaborate below.
    <li><b>Emotions</b>: Peace, serenity, love.</li>
</ul>

Also, I will make a note about possible alternate experiences of God. I think of myself as a very logical and analytical person, so maybe that is why my experiences are heavily based on my senses and cognition. I tend to expect that the fine details of my experiences are most pertinent to other nerds, who have similar characteristics, and so might connect with God in similar ways. It seems as though there are many people who are faithful, but they cannot articulate the specific reasons for their belief, so I will speculate that perhaps most people's belief is born out of empathy and intuition. I have never thought of myself as being skilled at intuition. However, my ability to feel my way through faith is evidence that I have it, and it is a valuable thing to cultivate. Everyone's seed is unique. We start out with different specialities, but we seek to grow into unity with God.
</p>   

<p>Faith is very much about perceiving the totality of your existence as a conversation with God. Then, having made a good faith attempt to interpret God's message, your objective is to do his will. But what if there is ambiguity or uncertainty? Then pray and continue to listen to the conversation. You will not always arrive at certainty, but the walk of faith means that you do the best you can with what you have, and you have faith that the net result of your journey will continue to accumulate goodness in the form of meaning, purpose, peace, love, and joy because God is your companion.</p>
    
<p>There are other important reasons to pray.</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>For more faith (of particular importance early on)</li>
    <li>For redemption and correction</li>
    <li>For guidance</li>
    <li>For hope</li>
    <li>For inspiration</li>
    <li>For comfort</li>
    <li>For intimacy</li>
    <li>And one of my favorites: to share love with God. It is a pleasant sensation</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.0 In Closing</h3>
<p>
Before I recognized my faith as a willingness to entertain the existence of God, it was seeded by many fragments of experience; ideas and concepts from friends, preachers, laymen, movies, books, and from every corner of life. What I didn't realize is that it was God who was watching and gradually knitting the pieces together as they collected in my experience. My story is a statement of truth as I perceive it, and it is my hope that it will resonate with you. I am hopeful that the ideas and experiences in it will be brought to life in your mind and experience by God if they are agreeable, useful, and good in his sight.
