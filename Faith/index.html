<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Many people profess a belief in God. Fewer people will claim that their relationship with God is a living, interactive experience with conversations, exchange of information, and the experience of miracles. The goal of this writing is to convey to others a detailed description of such a relationship in the hopes that it will be conducive to the propagation of faith, and in the achievement of similar intimacy with God.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is included in the intended audience, however as this is written from the perspective of a skeptic having previously emphasized logic and reason as a core philosophy, I hope that this will be found relevant to a similar audience because I, personally, had a high resistance to the acquisition of faith. Faith is not presented as a substitute for logic and reason, but as an additional virtue which is higher than those.
</p>

<p>
You will not find repeatable evidence for God here. Life is a conversation with God and everyone's life, and thus everyone's conversation, is different. When you converse with someone over the Internet, you do not require incontrovertible evidence that they are human. In the field of computing, we have a notion called the Turing Test, whereby we look at the substance of a conversation to decide if its source is intelligent. But the exact means of making that determination is not defined. It is left to intuition.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, if you work diligently at conversing with God, your experiences will reach a threshold where it is difficult, if not impossible, to deny that you are talking to God. The onus is on you to make the attempt at faith and then to decide whether the experiences you are provided meet some threshold of belief. If you are not satisfied, then I encourage you to pray (among a number of other reasons to pray). Also, later I attempt to outline motives on my part which I found conducive to a response.
</p>

<p>
Throughout, I will avoid references to dogma as "proof" or evidence. My initial resistance to the acceptance of Biblical writing was the lack of outside authentication for the Bible. I find that my personal experience of faith validates parts of the Bible (in my mind), but unfortunately these are private experiences which can only be approximated and then conveyed in writing. My hope is that, if the Bible does not resonate with you, then maybe my perspective will, and you will be motivated to reach out in faith.
</p>

<p>
I hope that this writing will be beneficial to anyone who is seeking God, whether they are beginning from atheism or some other belief. I am Christian because first, I began searching for God, and then he told me to be Christian (which I will narrate later in detail). I believe that Jesus was with me even before I was certain of Him. I believe that God and Jesus are with everyone. Jesus is there mitigating the condition of everyoneâ€™s lives, follower or not. The difference is that what we choose to give from faith to Jesus is multiplied, as in the Biblical parable of the loaves. To me, it was more intuitive to put the emphasis on the search for God first, prior to grasping the truth of Jesus. But that is just commentary on the route that I happened to take, and not a recommendation.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Put simply, God is good. But this can be elaborated upon significantly. The belief in spirituality alone offers a number of benefits by itself, but then the acknowledgement of a supreme being adds a great deal beyond that. Firstly, we are assured that our lives have value and meaning, otherwise why would we have been made? Furthermore, when we begin walking in faith, we discover that our actions have much more meaning when they are performed as an offering to God. We may have some notion of virtue within us, prior to acknowledging God. But, with limited knowledge and limited intelligence, and unlimited options about what to do with ourselves, we have little way of knowing what path will be fruitful. Without God, we are building sandcastles and wallowing in the earthly sandbox of human ephemera, but when we are contributing to God's purpose, we are building something eternal in heaven.</p>

<p>Let's consider a concrete example. I believe that charity is a virtue. I have $20, and I am walking past a crowd of homeless people. I need some of that money for myself, and there are many homeless. I need to decide whether to give, and if so how much, and to whom. What if I pick someone to give $5 to and they go to the liquor store and drink it all? Done out of faith, that might be what happens anyway, but God will multiply your efforts and see to it that they are made meaningful. Faith does not mean acting arbitrarily. It means appealing to God for purpose and direction, submitting to that direction, and living in the reassurance that when you are asking for guidance, that you are receiving it in some way (some ways more obvious than others). You don't need to see the end-result of your actions, though sometimes you might. God responds to your words and actions, and from that, you are assured that you have accomplished more than you can perceive.</p>

<p>God is the embodiment of all virtues combined. The highest of these, which I know, is love. Most people love someone, or if not, something. You may love your mom, or your wife, or your best friend. Or maybe you just love computing or engineering and you feel like there is a hole in your life. Knowing God is to grow in love and virtue and good things. Who doesn't want good things? God knows what is good for you better than you do. Some people claim that their success in business is due to God. This is possible, but I could not say. God is showing me that his goodness lives in heaven and that earthly affairs, when done correctly, are in service to Him, and they are good for everyone.</p>

<p>
Finally, there are the benefits of awe and adventure. God, after all, is omnipotent and all-knowing, and he can be very impressive and joyous to observe in action. However, he must not be mistaken for a conjurer of cheap tricks. All of the amazing things that He does are in service to His purposes. I did not experience God in action (much) until I aligned my prayers with his purposes. Do you want to see God do something amazing? To be entertained? To be comforted by the knowledge of someone all-powerful? To solve some personal problem? These motives did not work for me. Loving others, however, did.

<h2>A Personal Account of Evidence</h2>
<h3>The Setting</h3>
<p>
Shortly after the financial crisis of 2008, I broke up with my partner and lost my job. In the process of breaking up, she threatened suicide. This led me to Google for "suicide", and the top result was a story about a young woman named Suzanne who died tragically of suicide. Her story affected me profoundly. It stuck in my mind and attached itself to my soul. I read her online diary. I liked her a lot. I liked her earnest simplicity. She was funny, intelligent, had excellent taste in music (new and old), was technically competent, and I could relate to her sense of insurmountable emptiness and futility. I wondered if anyone of that sort survived, or if they all succumbed to suicide, or to some sort of lingering spiritual death at the hands of a soulless world. She reminded me of someone I had dated long ago, who happened to be married, and this did not help my sense of optimism. I wondered if maybe I might, by some slim chance, stumble onto someone ideal only to not recognize her in the depths of a soul-crushing cubicle labyrinth.
</p>

<p>
A series of good friends, to whom I am grateful, offered me their homes while I worked on getting my life back together, but I was far too deeply depressed. I had energy only for sleeping, or for online dating sites, which I hoped would alleviate the feeling of desolation that I had, but it was no use.
</p>

<h3>The Church</h3>
<p>
    I got in my truck and began the long drive home to South Carolina from Indiana. I felt pursued by something; whether by angels, or darkness, or police for sticking my nose into the infamous Suzanne story. I prayed for a church, and instantly, my life skipped like a movie, and there was a church to my left. I pulled into the parking lot and stepped out into the middle of the night. I looked up into the sky and thought I saw a star shining specifically for me, but I could not explain why. I heard a noise in the trees, and I wandered out in pursuit of it and found nothing but a sick oppossum. I went back to my truck and slept until morning.
</p>

<p>
    In the morning, I returned to the woods where I met an elderly man. He took out a pocket knife and cut an apple in half and he shared it with me. We discussed the Bible, and he said "Not everything in the Bible is true. You have to discern." I have since found this to be an invaluable lesson, as the journey of faith is fraught with the need for discernment. It is necessary to discern what comes from God, what comes from the self, and what comes from elsewhere. When I began walking in faith, I found that God's message was jumbled with everything else. The practice of walking in faith cultivates faith, and then God's message becomes more distinct. It gradually takes less effort to discern, and you make fewer errors. Your conversations with God become more productive, because you dedicate fewer steps to correcting what you got wrong.
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, I received no help at the church itself. They said "Sorry, we don't have any money", which I never asked for. So, I got back into my truck and drove on.
</p>

<h3>The Eye of Providence</h3>
<p>At some point, I began to experience visions of The Eye of Providence. It is a great cosmic eye rendered in brilliant gold light, in a shape similar to the Helix Nebula, an astronomical object. It can be seen on US currency. I found it interesting that at some point after having seen it in vision, I learned that it is specifically a Christian symbol, and not some generic symbol for God, or a god, etc. I should note that the color of the eye is important. The gold one is The Father in heaven.</p>

<p>One night, I laid in bed and I prayed, and I told God "What if we were to spread faith together? What if you tell me what to do, and then you intervene so as to lend significance to my action, and then both I and someone else benefit from the demonstration" I did not receive an answer I understod, but God was listening. I would add that when you talk to God successfully, it becomes less clear whose idea is whose. Sometimes I think God does all the thinking, and we are just a vessel for free will and desires and experiences.</p>

<p>I was excited to share the experience of the Eye of Providence with someone, so I went to the local coffee shop, which is a ministry. I wasn't sure who to tell, or where it would have some sort of supernatural impact, which is what I wanted to achieve. I sat at the coffee bar and contemplated telling the barista. Just then, the cross displayed on the wall glowed gold, and I decided that this was definitely confirmation. So, I told the barista about the Eye of Providence, and she revealed that she had such a tattoo hidden under her shirt. However, she refused my invitation to talk about it, saying that it was something occult she wanted to get rid of.</p>

<p>I don't know to what extent this served to benefit the barista. However, to me, it was confirmation that there was purpose and meaning behind the responses which I perceived from God.</p>

<h3>The Blind Monk Puzzle</h3>
<p>
One day, without going into great detail, I was metaphorically peering into the abyss. At that moment, I received an intense premonition of the actual abyss and I resolved to change course. I had a sudden certainty that God was telling me that I would find what I was looking for at the local coffee shop ministry. I hurried there with the expectation that I was going to meet someone. I traversed the establishment from front to back searching for this person, until I wandered into the very back room and the door locked behind me. I tried the back door which faced the outside, and it was also locked. It was dark and hard to see. I called for help and banged on the inner door, but there was another room, and then an auditorioum between me and the coffee bar, where everyone was. There was no way they would hear me. Above the back door was a bumper sticker which read "SOUL", as if to declare the room's confined contents. I had this electric sensation in my head that assured me that this was an act of God. I had been praying for more faith, so here I was, not exactly in an emergency, but in a definite quandry, and I felt like God was inviting me to grow in faith. So, I decided that I would give myself to faith so as to exit the room by some miracle. The thought of passing ghost-like through the wall crossed my mind.
</p>

<p>
So, I closed my eyes and prayed for guidance. I felt my way through the room purely by faith. I took a few steps to my left. I turned ninety degrees. Then I walked straight through a doorway I had not seen yet in the dark. I bumped into the wall and opened my eyes. In front of me, there was a circuit breaker, which I threw. The staff immediately came and let me out. They said "Wow! That was pretty smart of you!". I sheepishly hurried home, unable to describe what had just happened.
</p>
    
<p>
This is not a demonstration of how to apply faith to your daily life. In your daily life, you are supposed to keep your eyes open and use all of your senses and faculties in concert with faith in order to do the best you can. This worked because I had specifically prayed for a demonstration of faith at work, and when it was provided to me, I recognized it and chose to go with it. Because of events like this, I now believe very strongly, and I am willing to look for opportunities to work with God for the benefit of others. People tend to find ready excuses for which to dismiss individual events as coincidences and accidents, so those of us who believe rely on God to show us how to bring maximum meaning into the lives of others so that they will reach outside earthly confines.
</p>

<h3>Epiphany</h3>
<p>
One day, I was having another distinctly spiritual experience. I closed my eyes and prayed for faith. I saw the Eye of Providence again, and I experienced the vaguest intimation of water flowing around and past me, as if I were swimming towards the eye. So, I prayed "I guess I'm supposed to go swimming? In January?". "At the pool?", I asked, and the answer seemed to come back "The ocean". This seemed like a daunting task in early January, but faith seemed like a worthwhile reward, so I went about the business of obeying. Before I could go swimming, I felt that I was told "You don't have to do that", so I went home.</p>

<p>I logged onto an Internet chat room to share this story with whoever would listen, and they noted that the day on which this happened was a Christian feast day; Epiphany. Not knowing much about Christian tradition, I searched Wikipedia for "Epiphany", and immediately discovered that there is a tradition of going swimming in the icy winter ocean on the occasion of Epiphany. I had specifically asked God for some demonstration which I could not confuse with a psychological anomaly. The receipt of new knowledge through prayer (the knowledge of the winter swimming tradition) qualifies. It is one thing to contemplate the possibility that my brain is creating illusions, but for this to be an illusion, I would have to have acquired outside information from nothing. It is an illustration of the density with which God packages meaning when we consider that the word "epiphany" means a sudden revelation or realization.
