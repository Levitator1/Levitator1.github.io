        Verizon screws up absolutley everything

<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>
    An epically ridiculous but true tale of what it's like to cope with life as a Verizon customer.
    I feel that this needs to be published because otherwise service and product quality will freefall
    in the absence of the outrage or criticism which is so richly deserved. I don't think it needs much
    explanation or commentary, as it was, from its inception, self-explanatory in its attempt to convey
    to Verizon how to stop being an insufferable assemblage of clowns masquerading as professionals.

<p>
   The short version is that nobody knows what they're doing, you have to waste hours of your life to come to an agreement, and when you finally do, the person that's supposed to honor that
   agreement refuses to. They try to tell me that breakage is not covered under warranty even after they've already agreed to replace the phone. Then, when I try to replace the phone,
   it turns out that it's been discontinued (probably because it breaks all the time and there are complaints to that effect on Verizon's Web site). This is maybe half of the story because we haven't
   even yet discussed what an adventure it is to get Verizon to sell you the correct phone in the first place, but that's in here, too. It's not really possible to summarize how stupid this story it is. It has to be seen in its entirety.

<h1> The initial message to Corporate </h1>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hi. I need to tell you that whoever is in charge of hiring and training your staff in the Myrtle Beach region, they are massively dropping the ball, and their service levels are genuinely and without any hyperbole, the worst I have experienced in my entire life. I bought a flip phone from you, and the hinge cracked. Verizon Support Chat assured me that I could visit my local store (Seaboard St., Myrtle Beach) and receive a warranty replacement. I go there, and I encounter a store manager with whom I have had problems in the past. She tells me that physical damage is not covered. I ask her whose policy that is (surprised because this contradicts Support Chat). She says it's the manufacturer's. I asked her whether I would find that stipulation reading the warranty text, and she said she had not read the warranty. Rather then grow upset or offended at her second major refusal to provide any customer service whatsoever, I laughed at her, she took offense, and ultimately told me that I could leave the store if I was going to regard her as I did. I can assure you that her lying, evasion, misconduct, and pervasive resistance to perform her basic job duties is more offensive than anything I have ever said to her. Here, she is refusing to follow through on a commitment from Support Chat. This parallels precisely the previous case, where Verizon sold me a phone which did not provide the features agreed upon. Verizon Chat agreed to fix their error at cost, at the store, which I was very glad and satisfied to hear. The problem is that when I went to the store, I encountered this same manager, and she attempted to claim that she did not have a boss above her, and that she was not obligated to honor Verizon's commitments. It was not until I convinced her that not only am I not dumb enough to believe that she lacks a boss, I fully intended to speak to them about her behavior. Only then did she relent and do her job. This is not even the end of this spectacle.

<p>
Returning to the issue at hand, I have a phone I need replaced, so having encountered friction with this manager again, I called your other store in North Myrtle Beach. I spoke to the clerk, who looked up my phone number and told me that the phone was covered with insurance, in addition to the warranty. I was happy to hear this, and not entirely surprised, since it's XXXXXXXXX that manages and pays for the account. Then, I spoke to Verizon Support Chat and they told me that no, regretfully, that was not the case, and the phone is not covered by insurance. So, then, let me recap. Verizon Chat instructed, welcomed me, to exchange the phone at the store. But when I go to one store, I encounter a manager who lies and outright refuses to perform her basic job duties unless  it is in the sight of a superior. When I call the other store, I encounter a clerk who appears to be illiterate and unable to understand what coverage applies to the phone. Quite factually, I must tell you that I am at an impasse. It is not my job to wrangle your employees, and I ask that you please identify a responsible and capable individual with some managerial authority and assign to them the task of walking this exceedingly basic customer service issue to completion.

<p>
It is my opinion that whoever is in charge of these two stores, be they a regional manager or whatever, they are totally out-of-touch and oblivious to the needs of their establishments. They have no sense of whether the people they hire are capable of the jobs assigned. They do not provide adequate training or evaluation to ensure that they can perform basic tasks, such as reading or using a computer. They display no notion of accountability or obligation to either customers or superiors. You have a store manager who appears to not understand that even though she is in charge of the store, that the people who write her check are more in charge than she is. This region is a customer service disaster, and I ask that you please address this situation in the furtherance of public safety and economic security, as phone service is important to both.

<p>
Thank you very much.

Dear Jose Batista,<br>
Thank you for your patience while we investigated this concern. First off, I want to thank you for your feedback. We always want to make sure your customer experience is a great way, and the feedback you provide always helps us, so thank you.
With regard to your phone, the Alcatel Go Flip V on the line ending in 1685, I have confirmed this line does not pay extra for any device insurance. This phone was purchased in June of 2021 and still has a one-year manufacturer's warranty. The manufacturer's warranty covers any issues/defects that are not related to physical or liquid damage or lost/stolen phones.
With the issue on your phone being the hinge, this would fall under the physical damage aspect which is not covered under the manufacturer's warranty.
Once again I apologize for the experience and the confusion. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.<br>

<p>
Thanks,<br>

1) You did nothing to address your manager's misconduct at the Seaboard street store<br>
2) You did nothing to address the issue that your North Myrtle Beach store is unable to look up or properly discern product warranty status<br>
3) If your phone's hinge breaks under normal use, then that is a manufacturing or engineering defect<br>
<br>

<p>I do not think I will ever be doing business with Verizon ever, nor will I ever endorse or appraise you favorably. You are a total failure. If this account were not paid for by someone other than myself, I would cancel your service ten times if it were possible. You are a disgrace and it is my hope that your customers will vote with their feet, and that you will all find more apt careers, upon which the safety and prosperity of the public do not depend. Your customer service is shameful garbage, and you are incompetent. Goodbye.<br>

<p>Dear Jose Batista,<br>
<p>This is never the experience we want you to have. I can assure you that all employee coachings and feedback are handled and addressed internally.
As previously discussed, the warranty only covers issues not related to physical and liquid damage or lost/stolen devices. If you believe the hinge is an issue, you would need to contact the manufacturer directly. You will have to send them your phone for inspection for them to let you know if it is covered.<br>

What we can do is offer you a $50.00 discount off the retail price on a new phone of your choice. Here is a list of our current basic phones available. Please let me know if you will want to purchase a new phone. https://www.verizon.com/basic-phones/<br>

Oh, you want to keep chatting about how you are making a spectacular performance art of flubbing up customer service? I checked the warranty on the phone, and nowhere does it stipulate that physical breakage is exempt from coverage. I called the manufacturer and they attempted to claim the same thing. Funnily enough, when I requested that they cite the specific text in the warranty which supports this claim, they could not do so, because they are making things up. I don't know what the hell happened to ethical standards in this civilization, but you are a vivid illustration of the progression of the ethical rot which is causing the nation and the larger world to gradually collapse, where everybody demands their money and their checks, but they have no sense of accountability or obligation to deliver a service or product with integrity, honesty, or quality.

<p>
That's so generous of you! A $50 discount. How do you suppose that I should go about claiming that discount when, as I have explained to you already, your store manager denies that she has superiors, or that she is answerable to anyone outside of her petty whims? I explained that to you rather laboriously. I'm going to show up at the store, and she's going to waste hours of my time as I struggle to explain to her how employer/employee relationships work. This grossly incompetent, lazy, and/or ignorant woman does not have any realistic or sensible understanding of what it means to be employed by another person, and she should not be permitted to do any job which puts in her hands responsibility over any product that pertains to safety or emergency response, as phones often do.

<p>
If you want to tell me that you have called ahead to the store to notify their management of this arrangement, then that would be the reasonable, responsible and common-sense thing to do to attempt to remedy this situation. However, given my experience thus far, I know it's not going to happen unless I put on my manager hat and tell you how to not screw absolutely everything up. I shouldn't have to do that because I'm not on your payroll. Do me a favor and tell me when you have done that, and I will take you up on that offer solely and only because someone other than me pays for this account, and I need to be able to call 911 in the event that other lazy and entitled people should create an emergency through bewildering acts of incompetence and self-entitlement.<br>

<p>Thank you very much.

Dear Jose Batista,<br>
The details of Alcatel's warranty on your Alcatel Go Flip V phone can be found here: https://us.alcatelmobile.com/warranty/
It lists at the first bullet point under items and conditions not covered that damage from normal wear and tear is not a defect under the warranty. You will need to discuss this matter with Alcatel since it is their warranty.
For the $50.00 discount we are offering, we can offer the discount here. I will place the order for you so that you will not have to work with the store. If you are not sure or are not comfortable please let me know and I can contact the account owner regarding the offer we are presenting.<br>

Your efforts to weasel out of the fact that I I would be cutting you a deal and not vice versa are duly noted. The hinge fracturing a couple of months into normal use is not normal wear and tear. If I buy a car and the tires go bald after 60k miles, that's normal wear and tear. If I buy a car and the steering wheel falls off two months in, that's not normal wear and tear. You know that and I know that. You know, what? Let's just stop talking to each other, other than for the purpose of replacing the phone. I know you're wrong. And you're going to keep evading and making excuses and telling me that the sky is green because you are part of a pathological sickness that is entrenched in society and, were it my preference, I would have nothing to do with you. I will get back to you when I have the money. I will replace my phone. And then it is my hope that I have absolutely nothing to do with the likes of you for the longest time possible.<br>

Per our agreement, please provide a quote, or at least a price total to replace my current Alcatel flip phone, same model. If/when I accept this quote, you may bill that total to the owner/head/manager of the joint Verizon account.  You may ship me the product via USPS or UPS. I will not collect at the store. I expect to see a $50 credit, as we agreed.

<p>
Thank you.

<p>I am almost speechless. I want you to realize that as spectacular and shameful as my narrative is so far, it's incomplete. It took me literal weeks to identify this phone as meeting my requirements. Do you know why? It's because your staff is profoundly inept, and I was not getting the help I need identifying a phone, so I bought an unlocked phone and it didn't work because it was unsupported on your network. Well, at that point I resigned myself to having to rely on your totally incapable staff to identify a proper product for me, so after wasting countless hours struggling to communicate with individuals who probably should not have been permitted to pass about the third grade, I arrived at a model suggestion which seemed reasonable. I purchased this phone, and was completely unsurprised when it failed to deliver the agreed upon features. After the usual multi-hour effort waiting on hold, and navigating incapable and unwilling representatives, I found a Verizon rep who agreed that Verizon would exchange the phone and upgrade it to a suitable phone at cost, as was fair enough, since you (Verizon) sold me the wrong phone in the first place.

<p>This is the point at which I experienced the first debacle with your totally insane and lazy store manager who advised me that there was no policy in place for her to honor the agreement that Verizon had made with me. When I demanded to speak to her manager, she told me that she answered to nobody and that the store was hers to run as  she saw fit, and she did not have to honor any arrangement made by her non-existent superiors. It was not until I made it clear that her blatant lie defied common sense, and that I would be identifying her manager and reporting her insubordination to them, that she finally relented and casually did her job, which she always had the capability to do; just not the motivation or integrity.

<p>Now, given this story, you tell me if I should be stupid enough to repeat this hair-pullingly assinine process to identify my next replacement. I'm going to have to give you a hard "no" on that. I will ask that you please identify a proper phone for my purposes and save me this misery.

<p>I am looking for an inexpensive non-Android, non-iOS phone which supports Internet access via USB tethering, and not just hot spots, because hot spots waste battery life with needless radio transmission.

<p>
As a matter of pure commentary, I will take just a moment to suggest to you that Verizon is a victim of some pervasive and flawed philosophy. Your problems and failures are not isolated. You have a systematic inability to attract even the most pedestrian and non-exotic talent. In your hiring process, you are unable or unwilling to discern between literacy and illiteracy, and you clearly have no initiatives to train, educate, or otherwise improve the workforce you retain. You make zero effort to evaluate your employees for competence or skill, perhaps because it has grown culturally or socially fashionable to eschew testing, or ratings, or judgment, in the view that they are somehow inherently unfair. I will tell you what is unfair; it is to subject your customers to an endless procession of total incompetence not just at a technical level, but at a basic philosophical level, embodied by a seeming unawareness of accountability, nor of any notion of what proper behavior is owed as an employee, or towards a customer whose money funds the business. It is one thing to work for a phone company and not understand basic technical telephone concepts, like tethering. It is a whole other and deeper level of failure when you feel entitled to a paycheck simply for showing up, and you have no concept that you owe some standard of quality or service to the individuals whose money keeps a roof over your head and food on your plate.

<p>
You are a corporate disaster, and if the state of your company is any indication of where the larger nation and culture are headed, then God help us indeed.

Dear Jose Batista,<br>

<p>Remaining within the same price range and feature list for our basic phones, there is the TCL FLIP Pro, Verizon Orbic Journey L, Verizon Orbic Journey V, and KAZUNA eTalk. All of these phones support USB Tethering and run on the same network.

<p>We suggest reviewing all of those devices here to ensure the phone meets your other criteria: https://www.verizon.com/basic-phones/

<p>If you cannot decide on a phone at this time, the $50.00 credit will be applied to your account so that you can purchase the phone at a later time when you are ready.

Let's see, so you stopped stocking my phone right after I bought it. Could it be because it breaks all the damn time, and yet you are sitting here claiming that it's normal "wear and tear"? Here's a review of your garbage product from your own Web site:

<p>
Hinge easily broken

<blockquote>
SJA1 - Sep 16, 2021
This is the second Alcatel GO FlipV that we have purchased from Verizon. The plastic in the hinge area has cracked and broke again. Even though this is a simple phone for someone who doesn't want a Smart phone, it is not durable. I do not recommend it.

<p>If I had the time and energy, I would go file a lawsuit in small claims court, but I don't, so you will get off with being told that you are a bunch of crooks and shit mongers, and I hope you go bankrupt. I don't want to hear about how I'm being rude to you, because your disrespect is leaps and bounds beyond anything I have ever directed at you. You suck. I will get back to you in a moment with the model of the replacement phone, and you can enjoy your ill gotten $50, or whatever.

<h1> Epilogue </h1>

<p>I think I will close simply with the statement that after all of this, the phone I finally wound up with, the Kazuna eTalk, has defective hardware or firmware, where it loses keystrokes and you are forced to watch the screen to
ensure that it picked up each digit as you dial it. If you don't do that, then you're liable to find that half the digits you dialed are missing, and you have to clear them out and start over. This is less of a big deal than
the issue where the clamshell switch seems to suffer from the same buffering problem. This means that sometimes, you will close the phone, and it will lose the update from the switch in the hinge. This means that you will be
walking around with your phone line open when you think you have hung up. So, you can add your privacy to the extensive list that of things that Verizon does not care about, with you at the very top.
